### Environment
Python 3.7.3  
Anaconda 1.9.0  
Conda 4.12.0  
Jupyter notebook 6.1.12  
Pandas 1.3.4  
SQLite 2.6.0

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze weather data (mainly precipitation and temperature) in order to convince the investors about the "Surf n' Shake" project.   
The investor is specifically concerned about the weather in Oahu for the months of June and December. The investor wants determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
The data analyzed presents Ohau as a sustainable year-round location for a surf-and-ice cream business.

* Summer (June) and winter (December) average temparatures are between 71 and 75 degrees. This is a great average temperature for surf and ice-cream.  
* Summer (June) and winter (December) temperatures variation (std) is less than 4 degrees. This means that the temperature isn't highly variable which suggests that Oahu is sustainable year-round location for surf and ice cream.

* Even if the minimum and maximum temperatures could be a problem, the frecuency or quantity of observations of these temperatures is very low.

* Less than 3/4 of daily rainfall measurements, over a three year period, show less than 0.14 inches. This data, modified from work done in the module, shows that average rainfall is fairly light. This means that you don't have to worry about bad weather at the beach or your triple-scoop sundae having an unwanted topping of rain drops.


## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
